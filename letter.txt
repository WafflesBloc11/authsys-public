Hi

Thanks for signing up at bloc 11!

Those are a few rules that will make your visit to bloc 11
a much more pleasant experience for everyone. Please make sure
you read and follow those instructions. Violation of safety
rules might end up in termination of membership.

* Climbs finish on the last hold of the color,
  no topping out or grabbing the top of the wall!

* Climbing is an inherently dangerous sport - watch
  out and don't walk under people climbing.

* The climbs follow certain colors and go as follows:
  white, blue, black, purple, yellow, red, green. There
  is a chart on the wall.

* Don't park in front of our neighbours. Park inside the
  Island Park, the driveway is to the left of our entrance
  (towards the canal). Map of the surroundings:
